These photoneutron data are used to extract the γ-ray strength function above the neutron threshold, complementing the information obtained by the Oslo method below the threshold. We discuss radiative neutron-capture cross sections and the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections for Ni isotopes including 63Ni, a branching point nucleus along the weak s-process path. The cross sections are calculated with the experimentally constrained γ-ray strength functions from the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov plus quasiparticle–random-phase approximation based on the Gogny D1M interaction for both E1 and M1 components and supplemented with the M1 upbend.},

	abstract = {In physics, a phonon is a collective excitation in a periodic, elastic arrangement of atoms or molecules in condensed matter, specifically in solids and some liquids. Often referred to as a quasiparticle, it is an excited state in the quantum mechanical quantization of the modes of vibrations for elastic structures of interacting particles. Phonons can be thought of as quantized sound waves, similar to photons as quantized light waves.The study of phonons is an important part of condensed matter physics. They play a major role in many of the physical properties of condensed matter systems, such as thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, as well as play a fundamental role in models of neutron scattering and related effects. The concept of phonons was introduced in 1932 by Soviet physicist Igor Tamm. The name phonon comes from the Greek word φωνή (phonē), which translates to sound or voice, because long-wavelength phonons give rise to sound. The name is analogous to the word photon.},

	abstract = {Two photo-neutron sources, \$ˆ\{88\}\$Y\$ˆ\{9\}\$Be and \$ˆ\{124\}\$Sb\$ˆ\{9\}\$Be, have been used to investigate the ionization yield of nuclear recoils in the {CDMSlite} germanium detectors by the {SuperCDMS} collaboration. This work evaluates the yield for nuclear recoil energies between 1 {keV} and 7 {keV} at a temperature of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsim\$ 50 {mK}. We use a Geant4 simulation to model the neutron spectrum assuming a charge yield model that is a generalization of the standard Lindhard model and consists of two energy dependent parameters. We perform a likelihood analysis using the simulated neutron spectrum, modeled background, and experimental data to obtain the best fit values of the yield model. The ionization yield between recoil energies of 1 {keV} and 7 {keV} is shown to be significantly lower than predicted by the standard Lindhard model for germanium. There is a general lack of agreement among different experiments using a variety of techniques studying the low-energy range of the nuclear recoil yield, which is most critical for interpretation of direct dark matter searches. This suggests complexity in the physical process that many direct detection experiments use to model their primary signal detection mechanism and highlights the need for further studies to clarify underlying systematic effects that have not been well understood up to this point.},

	abstract = {Accelerator-based photoneutron sources have enjoyed wide use and offer the advantages of long term stability, ease of control and absence of radioactive materials. We report here measurements of the yield of photoneutrons from a neutron generator using a compact betatron. Electrons were accelerated to energies up to 10MeV and produced a bremsstrahlung beam with a dose rate of 0.16Gy/min (at 10MeV, 1m from the bremsstrahlung target) to irradiate {LiD}, Be, depleted U, and Pb neutron-producing targets. The angular distributions of photoneutrons produced by bremsstrahlung beams were measured with a “long” counter and integrated to determine neutron yield. In addition, neutron time of flight spectra were recorded from all targets using a 15.5m flight path perpendicular to the photon beam. The maximum observed yields were 4.6×107n/s obtained with 1kg of {LiD}, 5.7×107n/s from a 3.3kg Be block, 6.2×106n/s from 1.5kg of depleted U, and 7.0×106n/s from 10.7kg of Pb. Optimization of target dimensions, shape, and positioning is expected to increase the yield from the {LiD} target by a factor of 35, while optimization of the other targets is expected to yield at most a factor of 10. With the increased yield and a deuteride target, this compact betatron-based system could find application in the interrogation of waste containers for fissile material.},

How to manage the life-cycle of sensors in such large-scale deployments is currently an open issue. Indeed, most deployments let sensors operate until they fail and fix or replace the sensors post-hoc. In this paper, we contribute by developing a new approach for facilitating the life-cycle management of large-scale sensor deployments through online estimation of battery health. Our approach relies on so-called V-edge dynamics which capture and characterize instantaneous voltage drops. Experiments carried out on a dataset of battery discharge measurements demonstrate that our approach is capable of estimating battery health with up to \$80\%\$ accuracy, depending on the characteristics of the devices and the processing load they undergo. Our method is particularly well-suited for the sensor devices, operating dedicated tasks, that they have constant discharge during their operation.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of the state-of-charge ({SoC}) and state-of-health ({SoH}) for an operating battery system, as a critical task for battery health management, greatly depends on the validity and generalizability of battery models. Due to the variability and uncertainties involved in battery design, manufacturing and operation, developing a generally applicable battery model remains as a grand challenge for battery health management. To eliminate the dependency of {SoC} and {SoH} estimation on battery physical models, this paper presents a generic data-driven approach that integrates an artificial neural network with a dual extended Kalman filter ({DEKF}) algorithm for lithium-ion battery health management. The artificial neural network is first trained offline to model the battery terminal voltages and the {DEKF} algorithm can then be employed online for {SoC} and {SoH} estimation, where voltage outputs from the trained artificial neural network model are used in {DEKF} state–space equations to replace the required battery models. The trained neural network model can be adaptively updated to account for the battery to battery variability, thus ensuring good {SoC} and {SoH} estimation accuracy. Experimental results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model-free approach for battery health management.},

The state-of-health ({SoH}) of batteries quantifies their degradation, but mobile devices are unable to support its accurate estimation – despite its importance – due mainly to their limited hardware and dynamic usage patterns, causing various problems such as unexpected device shutoffs or even fire/explosion. To remedy this lack of support, we design, implement and evaluate V-Health, a low-cost user-level {SoH} estimation service for mobile devices based only on their battery voltage, which is commonly available on all commodity mobile devices. V-Health also enables four novel use-cases that improve mobile users' experience from different perspectives. The design of V-Health is inspired by our empirical finding that the relaxing voltages of a device battery fingerprint its {SoH}, and is steered by extensive measurements with 15 batteries used for various commodity mobile devices, such as Nexus 6P, Galaxy S3, {iPhone} 6 Plus, etc. These measurements consist of 13,377 battery discharging/charging/resting cycles and have been conducted over 72 months cumulatively. V-Health has been evaluated via both laboratory experiments and field tests over 4-6 months, showing {\textbackslash}textless5\% error in {SoH} estimation.},

	abstract = {Of the six types of radioisotope thermoelectric generators {NASA} has flown in space, only the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator ({MMRTG}) is currently available for spaceflight, and it relies on technology first used for {RTGs} in the 1970s. The {MMRTG} is a rugged power system capable of delivering 110W at launch. {NASA} is considering future missions with higher power demands however, and sponsored a study to identify concepts and plans to address those needs. The Director of {NASA}’s Planetary Sciences Division was briefed on a potential enhancement to the {MMRTG} in late-2012, just a couple of days after the landing of the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, on Mars. {NASA} subsequently funded system-level engineering and technology maturation tasks for a proposed enhanced {MMRTG}, or {eMMRTG}, in fiscal year 2013. There was no plan to build a complete generator, rather the engineering of one, and the transfer of technology from laboratories at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to industry were begun. {NASA} has now formed a Project to take the {eMMRTG} from technology to a qualification unit. This would form the first of a new generation of {RTGs} in 50 years. {NASA} has also formed a Project for a Next-Generation {RTG} concept based upon a study led by this author and a large team. {NASA}’s Radioisotope Power Systems ({RPS}) Program set the objective for the study to explore what possible options {NASA} has for Next-Generation-{RTGs}. The scope and breadth of the study included many possible destinations within the solar system, and traded a variety of {RTG} conceptual designs, and risk rated a variety of thermoelectric materials and couple configurations. Requirements were defined for the {RTG} concepts, a variety of thermoelectric materials were evaluated to find the most mature candidates, and performance was estimated for each {RTG} concept that could use the most mature of these new thermoelectric materials. The study relied upon mission concepts outlined in the latest Planetary Science Decadal Survey (2011), other more recent mission studies completed throughout the agency, and recent analyses of potential missions to ocean worlds to identify requirements that were not applied to previous {RTGs} but might prove valuable to these {NG}-{RTGs}. {RTG} concepts with maximal potential utility were identified as being modular and ranging in power output from 50 to 500W. A variety of {RTG} design concepts with several distinguishing characteristics were formulated. The plans and concepts for a new generation of {RTGs} (the {eMMRTG} and {NG}-{RTG}) will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Uranium-238 (238U or U-238) is the most common isotope of uranium found in nature, with a relative abundance of 99\%. Unlike uranium-235, it is non-fissile, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction in a thermal-neutron reactor. However, it is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239. 238U cannot support a chain reaction because inelastic scattering reduces neutron energy below the range where fast fission of one or more next-generation nuclei is probable. Doppler broadening of 238U's neutron absorption resonances, increasing absorption as fuel temperature increases, is also an essential negative feedback mechanism for reactor control. Around 99.284\% of natural uranium's mass is uranium-238, which has a half-life of 1.41×1017 seconds (4.468×109 years, or 4.468 billion years). Due to its natural abundance and half-life relative to other radioactive elements, 238U produces {\textbackslash}textasciitilde40\% of the radioactive heat produced within the Earth. The 238U decay chain contributes 6 electron anti-neutrinos per 238U nucleus (1 per beta decay), resulting in a large detectable geoneutrino signal when decays occur within the Earth. The decay of 238U to daughter isotopes is extensively used in radiometric dating, particularly for material older than {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1 million years. Depleted uranium has an even higher concentration of the 238U isotope, and even low-enriched uranium ({LEU}), while having a higher proportion of the uranium-235 isotope (in comparison to depleted uranium), is still mostly 238U. Reprocessed uranium is also mainly 238U, with about as much uranium-235 as natural uranium, a comparable proportion of uranium-236, and much smaller amounts of other isotopes of uranium such as uranium-234, uranium-233, and uranium-232.},

	abstract = {We report here for the first time a fabrication of betavoltaic battery prototype consisting of 200 single conversion cells based on Schottky barrier diamond diodes which have been vertically stacked with {\textbackslash}textasciitilde24\% 63Ni radioactive isotope. The maximum electrical output power of about 0.93 μW was obtained in total volume of 5 × 5 × 3.5 mm3. We used the ion-beam assisted lift-off technique to obtain conversion cells of minimal thickness comparable with the characteristic penetration length of beta-particles emitted by 63Ni isotope. The obtained value of 15 μm was limited by the mechanical strength of produced structures and process reliability. To check the performance of thin diamond based conversion cells we carried out {IV}-curves measurements at electron beam irradiation in {SEM}. We found that the sacrificial layer for the splitting of such thin conversion cell from {HPHT} diamond substrate did not cause a considerable degradation of device charge collection efficiency. As a result, the fabricated prototype provided the output power density of about 10 μW/cm3, that is the best known value for nuclear batteries based on 63Ni radioisotope. Moreover, the long half-life of 63Ni isotope gives the battery specific energy of about 3300 {mWh}/g that is an order of magnitude higher than the typical value of commercial chemical cells.},

At the core of the Curiosity rover power subsystem is the F1 Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator ({MMRTG}) supplied by the Department of Energy. Integration of the F1 {MMRTG} into the {MSL} spacecraft has provided the first opportunity to architect a power subsystem that also included a Solar Array (during the cruise phase of the mission and up to the initial stage of the {EDL} phase) and secondary Li-ion batteries for operation during the planned one Martian year surface phase of the mission. This paper describes the F1 {MMRTG} functional features as an enabler of the {MSL} mission and as a novel component of the {MSL} power subsystem architecture.},

	abstract = {Direct charging nuclear batteries ({DCNB}) have the potential of being widely used to meet the special requirements in the area of aerospace and ocean. The current application of direct charging nuclear batteries is restricted by the low energy conversion efficiency, commonly less than 10\%. This low efficiency is limited mainly by issues of low source efficiency and shunt factor among others, such as collection and geometry factors. Based on a numerical simulation and empirical calculations we here propose a design of {DCNB} by utilization of a sub-micrometer thickness radiation source to increase the source efficiency, both-side emission, and collection of decay particles to improve the collection and geometry factors, as well as impedance matching of batteries and load to improve the shunt factor, among other various optimizations. The energy conversion efficiency of {DCNB} with this design reaches over 20\%. The successful deployment of the current design should vastly improve the energy conversion efficiency of {DCNBs}, and also establish a theoretical foundation for extending the scope of applications of {DCNBs} in the future.},

	abstract = {The use of radioisotopes in nuclear medicine is essential for diagnosing and treating cancer. The optimization of their production is a key factor in maximizing the production yield and minimizing the associated costs. An efficient approach to this problem is the use of Monte Carlo simulations prior to experimentation. By predicting isotopes yields, one can study the isotope of interest expected activity for different energy ranges. One can also study the target contamination with other radioisotopes, especially undesired radioisotopes of the wanted chemical element which are difficult to separate from the irradiated target and might result in increasing the dose when delivering the radiopharmaceutical product to the patient. The aim of this work is to build and validate a Monte Carlo simulation platform using the {GEANT}4 toolkit to model the solid target system of the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute ({SAHMRI}) {GE} Healthcare {PETtrace} cyclotron. It includes a {GEANT}4 Graphical User Interface ({GUI}) where the user can modify simulation parameters such as the energy, shape and current of the proton beam, the target geometry and material, the foil geometry and material and the time of irradiation. The paper describes the simulation and presents a comparison of simulated and experimental/theoretical yields for various nuclear reactions on an enriched nickel 64 target using the {GEANT}4 physics model {QGSP}\_BIC\_AllHP, a model recently developed to evaluate with high precision the interaction of protons with energies below 200MeV available in Geant4 version 10.1. The simulation yield of the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu reaction was found to be 7.67±0.074 {mCi}·μA−1 for a target energy range of 9–12MeV. Szelecsenyi et al. (1993) gives a theoretical yield of 6.71mCi·μA−1 and an experimental yield of 6.38mCi·μA−1. The 64Ni(p,n)64Cu cross section obtained with the simulation was also verified against the yield predicted from the nuclear database {TENDL} and compared to experimental yield obtained from literature.},

Evidently, {SRIM} stopping power must be too high at low energy in these cases. This leads to the question: are there any stopping power measurements that show this directly? There are a few, indeed. We first discuss the description of nuclear stopping in {SRIM}, and then discuss these measurements. Naturally, the contribution of nuclear stopping is large in these cases. Assuming that {SRIM} nuclear stopping is correct, we find that indeed, {SRIM} electronic stopping is much too high at low energy.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines interaction probability as quantified by cross section. The radiation cross section is the effective area a target presents to a projectile. It determines the probability of the projectile interacting with the target. The cross section that indicates the probability of interaction has dimensions of area, while the probability is a dimensionless quantity. Since the cross section defines in essence the interaction probability, its value depends on the field effect of the target on the projectile. The target is represented by its potential field, while a projectile is depicted as a wave, with a wavelength given by the de Broglie wavelength. The effect of the nuclear forces is presented by a nuclear potential. This potential can be a simple square-well, with a constant potential energy over the entire radius of the nucleus, which is assumed to be spherical. The absorption cross section includes all interactions that involve the disappearance of the incident wave into the target. These interactions can be incorporated into the formation of a compound target, and absorption cross section becomes then the cross section for compound system formation. It is found that as with neutrons and photons, the cross sections for charged particles are formulated in terms of the angular differential cross section, which upon integration over all solid angles gives the overall interaction cross section.},

Nuclear fission mechanism, fission chain reaction leading to the notion of nuclear fission reactor, is explained. Basis for thermal and fast reactors is indicated. A student is expected to understand from this chapter, why a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, why it releases energy, how a chain reaction and a steady power production become feasible, and what the salient physics considerations are, in the design of a reactor, exploiting the dissimilar nuclear properties of different materials.},

The nuclei are of the type that exists in high-level radioactive wastes that are end products of the production of energy from nuclear fission. The basic physical mechanisms that underlie the coupling of the applied field to the nucleus have been identified. Both the basic theory and numerical predictions that stem from it support the conclusion that high-level radioactive wastes can be disposed of by substantially accelerating the rate of radioactive decay. Some old experiments on the acceleration of this type of radioactivity, with results that were not understood at the time, have been re-examined. Their interpretation is now clear, and the experiments are found to be in agreement with the theory.},

All nuclides for which any experimental information is known were considered. {NUBASE}2016 covers all data published by October 2016 in primary (journal articles) and secondary (mainly laboratory reports and conference proceedings) references, together with the corresponding bibliographical information. During the development of {NUBASE}2016, the data available in the ‘Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File’ ({ENSDF}) database were consulted and critically assessed for their validity and completeness. Furthermore, a large amount of new data and some older experimental results that were missing from {ENSDF} were compiled, evaluated and included in {NUBASE}2016. The atomic mass values were taken from the ‘Atomic Mass Evaluation’ ({AME}2016, second and third parts of the present issue). In cases where no experimental data were available for a particular nuclide, trends in the behavior of specific properties in neighboring nuclides ({TNN}) were examined. This approach allowed to estimate values for a range of properties that are labeled in {NUBASE}2016 as ‘non-experimental’ (flagged ‘\#’).

Following recent theoretical advances, a C++ implementation of an analytical description of the allowed beta spectrum shape was constructed. It implements all known corrections required to give a theoretical description accurate to a few parts in 104. The remaining nuclear structure-sensitive input can optionally be calculated in an extreme single-particle approximation with a variety of nuclear potentials, or obtained through an interface with more state-of-the-art computations. Due to its relevance in modern neutrino physics, the corresponding (anti)neutrino spectra are readily available with appropriate radiative corrections. In the interest of user-friendliness, a graphical interface was developed in Python with a coupling to a variety of nuclear databases. We present several test cases and illustrate potential usage of the code. Our work can be used as the foundation for current and future high-precision experiments related to the beta decay process.

We constructed an experimental setup for high-flux gamma-ray generation in the {SAGA} light source storage ring. A head-on collision between a 1.4GeV electron beam and laser photons with a 10.6μm wavelength produced gamma-rays up to a maximum energy of 3.5MeV. Since the laser Compton scattering does not influence the beam quality, these gamma-rays can be generated in conjunction with user time for synchrotron radiation research. The event rate was designed to be 1.4×108s−1 with a beam current of 300mA and a laser power of 10 W. As a first step in high-flux gamma-ray generation, we performed beam tests at a low beam current to evaluate the characteristics of the gamma-rays. Gamma-ray generation with no reduction in beam lifetime was confirmed by these tests. The experimental results show that the effective gamma-ray flux was almost 40\% of the design value. The laser Compton gamma-ray was also applied to measure the machine parameters of the storage ring. The beam energy was successfully determined with relative uncertainties on the order of 10−3 by analyzing the gamma-ray spectrum for the stored beam, which ranged in energy from 0.6 to 1.4GeV.},

However, the recent sustained technological progress is opening up the possibility of employing intense laser radiation to trigger or substantially influence physical processes beyond atomic-physics energy scales. Available optical laser intensities exceeding 1022 W/cm2 can push the fundamental light-electron interaction to the extreme limit where radiation-reaction effects dominate the electron dynamics, can shed light on the structure of the quantum vacuum, and can trigger the creation of particles such as electrons, muons, and pions and their corresponding antiparticles. Also, novel sources of intense coherent high-energy photons and laser-based particle colliders can pave the way to nuclear quantum optics and may even allow for the potential discovery of new particles beyond the standard model. These are the main topics of this article, which is devoted to a review of recent investigations on high-energy processes within the realm of relativistic quantum dynamics, quantum electrodynamics, and nuclear and particle physics, occurring in extremely intense laser fields.},

	abstract = {A photoinjector is a type of source for intense electron beams which relies on the photoelectric effect. A laser pulse incident onto the cathode of a photoinjector drives electrons out of it, and into the accelerating field of the electron gun. In comparison with the widespread thermionic electron gun, photoinjectors produce electron beams of higher brightness, which means more particles packed into smaller volume of phase space (beam emittance). Photoinjectors serve as the main electron source for single-pass synchrotron light sources, such as free-electron lasers and for ultrafast electron diffraction setups. The first {RF} photoinjector was developed in 1985 at Los Alamos National Laboratory and used as the source for a free-electron-laser experiment. High-brightness electron beams produced by photoinjectors are used directly or indirectly to probe the molecular, atomic and nuclear structure of matter for fundamental research, as well as material characterization. A photoinjector comprises a photocathode, electron gun ({AC} or {DC}), power supplies, driving laser system, timing and synchronization system, emittance compensation magnets. It can include vacuum system and cathode fabrication or transport system. It is usually followed by beam diagnostics and higher-energy accelerators. The key component of a photoinjector is a photocathode, which is located inside the cavity of electron gun (usually, a 0.6-fractional cell for optimal distribution of accelerating field). Extracted electron beam suffers from its own space-charge fields that deteriorate the beam brightness. For that reason, photoelectron guns often have one or more full-size booster cells to increase the beam energy and reduce the space-charge effect. The gun's accelerating field is {RF} (radio-frequency) wave provided by a klystron or other {RF} power source. For low-energy beams, such as ones used in electron diffraction and microscopy, electrostatic acceleration ({DC}) is a suitable. The photoemission on the cathode is initiated by an incident pulse from the driving laser. Depending on the material of the photocathode, the laser wavelength can vary from 1700 nm (infrared) down to 100-200 nm (ultraviolet). Emission from the cavity wall is possible with laser wavelength of about 250 nm for copper walls or cathodes. Semiconductor cathodes are often sensitive to ambient conditions and might require a clean preparation chamber located behind the photoelectron gun. The optical system of the driving laser is often designed to control the pulse structure, and consequently, the distribution of electrons in the extracted bunch. For example, a fs-scale laser pulse with an elliptical transverse profile creates a thin "pancake" electron bunch, that evolves into a uniformly filled ellipsoid under its own space-charge fields. A more sophisticated laser pulse with a comb-like longitudinal profile generates a similarly shaped, comb electron beam.},

Both systems consist of an electron cyclotron resonance ({ECR}) ion source, a low-energy beam transport system, an {RFQ} accelerator, a medium-energy beam transport system, a Be target, and a moderator system. In order to achieve a compact accelerator system at a reasonable cost, different requirements must be applied to the design of {RFQ} accelerators. The proton {RFQ} has been designed with an operation frequency of 352 {MHz}, up to 4 {MeV} acceleration, 10 {mA} beam intensity, and a continuous-wave ({CW}) operation mode to achieve 0.84 × 109 n/(s/cm2) of neutron production. However, the deuteron {RFQ} has been designed with an operation frequency of 200 {MHz}, up to 2.5 {MeV} acceleration, 15 {mA} of beam intensity, and a {CW} operation mode to achieve 1.02 × 109 n/(s/cm2) of neutron production. In this paper, we describe the merit of the deuteron based neutron source by comparing two types of the {RFQ} accelerators for proton and deuteron beams including the common system of the {ECR} ion source and Be target in detail.},

The problems are incredibly rich, and the physics deceptively subtle, but the caveats and special conditions even for the simple diode problem led van der Ziel to advise about Child's so-called law. Such a history of a law has more of Creon in it than Zeus, but referring to the limits placed on electron emission by cathode geometry and anode potential as the 'Child-Langmuir limiting relation for particular circumstances' lacks both panache and gravitas compared to referring to it as a 'law'.},

Such a source would offer new experimental possibilities in fundamental science, but in the cascade process radiation reaction and rapid electron-positron plasma production seemingly restrict the efficient production of photons to sub-{GeV} energies. Here, we show how to overcome these energetic restrictions and how to create a directed {GeV} photon source, with unique capabilities as compared to existing sources. Our new source concept is based on a controlled interplay between the cascade and anomalous radiative trapping. Using specially designed advanced numerical models supported with analytical estimates, we demonstrate that the concept becomes feasible at laser powers of around 7 {PW}, which is accessible at soon-to-be-available facilities. A higher peak power of 40 {PW} can provide 109 photons with {GeV} energies in a well-collimated 3-fs beam, achieving peak brilliance 9×1024 ph s−1 mrad−2 mm−2/0.1\%{BW}.},

Targets of enriched 179Hf (91\%) and {natHf} were bombarded with protons of energy in the range from 90 to 650MeV provided by the internal beam of the Dubna Phasotron synchrocyclotron. The activation yields of the reaction products were measured by using the γ-ray spectroscopy and radiochemistry methods. The production cross-sections obtained for the 179m2Hf, 178m2Hf and 177mLu isomers are similar to the previously measured values from the spallation of Ta, Re and W targets. Therefore, the reactions involving emission of only a few nucleons, like (p,p′), (p,p′n) and (p,2pn), can transfer high enough angular momentum to the final residual nuclei with reasonable large cross-sections. A significant gain in the isomeric yields was obtained when enriched 179Hf targets were used. The mass distribution of the residual nuclei was measured over a wide range of masses and the fission-to-spallation ratio could be deduced as a function of the projectile energy. Features of the reaction mechanism are briefly discussed.},

Here, we analyzed cell behavior on micro-patterns produced by various alternative techniques.

We report methods to overcome some of these limitations on glass coverslips and on plastic dishes which are compatible with our experimental biological applications.

We find that due to the complex plasma dynamics, the nuclear excitation rate and the actual number of excited nuclei do not reach their maximum at the same laser parameters. The nuclear excitation achievable with a high-power optical laser is up to twelve and up to six orders of magnitude larger than the values predicted for direct resonant and secondary plasma-mediated excitation at the x-ray free electron laser, respectively.

The binding energies of muonic atoms have been calculated introducing a state of the art modification to the Flexible Atomic Code. An analysis of experimental scenarios in the context of modern muon production facilities shows that the effect can be detectable for selected isotopes. The total probability of {NEμC} is predicted to be P≈1×10−6 per incident muon in a beam-based scenario. Given the high transition energy provided by muons, {NEμC} can have important consequences for isomer feeding and particle-induced fission.},

	abstract = {Acts attributed to single-particle stimulated emission, 125m2Te(γ,2γ)125m1Te, had been observed previously in a Be125m2Te sample as a variation of the line intensity at Eγ=109.27 {keV} and by the appearance of a line of double energy at E2γ=218.54 {keV}. This effect occurred when the sample temperature, T was lowered from 300 to 4 K. In the present work, the first observation is reported of stimulated emission events in the reaction 123m2Te(γ,2γ)123m1Te which were registered from a Mg3123m2TeO6 sample when cooled in a similar fashion. It is shown here that the mechanism of these experimentally observed events is polynuclear superradiance rather than a single-particle stimulated emission of Mössbauer radiation as earlier suggested.},

The analysis presented in this paper shows that this is not the case for Mössbauer experiments, unless the radiative width ΓΓ also increases. Although overlap occurs when the lines are homogeneously broadened to a total width Γ\_H which exceeds the natural width Γ, and the inhomogeneous width Δ, the Mössbauer absorption remains low because it is proportional to the factor of Γγ/ΓH.},

	abstract = {The single-photon echo ({SP}-echo) effect is predicted to appear in the case of three-level medium excitation by means of a single photon propagating to the medium along two optical paths with a mutual time delay surpassing the temporal duration of the photon wave packet. The quantum electrodynamical theory describing this interaction is presented and the S-matrix of the field is shown for infinite time (t=∞). Using the S-matrix approach, physical properties of the scattering field are studied. Hence, it is shown that the field has an echo signal at the ω320carrier frequency. It has been shown that the echo signal exists only in the field amplitude while being absent in its intensity behaviour. Thus, {SP}-echo is an interference effect and is not influenced by the energy irradiation. The problems of {SP}-echo detection in the gamma-region (where special generation difficulties appear) are discussed. The influence of the additional detection of theω210frequency field on the echo signal has been shown. A special case is the {EPR}-paradox which can appear within the echo phenomenon.},

	abstract = {An ion-optical system ({IOS}) for fast high-quality focusing of powerful paraxial ion beams of large format is suggested. Such beams could be enriched in excited short-lived (10-4-10-6 s) laser-active nuclei ({ELAN}). To increase the beam power, ions are collected from the visible surface (10-104 cm2) of an intermediate target (converter). The full converter surface is enhanced by a factor of 102-104 by a special micro-relief and achieves 103-107 m2. The toms containing {ELAN} are created in the converter by a powerful radiation source using neutrons, γ quanta, charged particles, etc. Those {ELAN} atoms are emitted from the converter surface and selectively ionized by a dye laser just above the surface. Using a specially chosen emitter (converter) shape, a paraxial ion beam is formed. This is due to the micro-relief structure of the emitter surface, its high-quality orientation, and cylindrical (instead of spherical) ion optics. In the vicinity of an active medium ({AM}) for a gamma-ray laser, the ions are decelerated so that they can penetrate only into 1-3 outer layers of the host matrix, e.g., diamond. This makes heating of the {AM} by the ion beam negligible in comparison to self-heating due to internal conversion. Analytical and numerical estimation of the {IOS} aberrations have shown that the compression of the ion beam exceeds105-106, and that a considerable part (10\%) of the {ELAN} reach the {AM} in a time as short as10-7 s. This ensures the rapid and controllable deposition of {ELAN} into an {AM} within a gamma-laser system based on existing techniques without using nuclear explosions.},

This crystal contacts with an outer cooler. The {AM} dimensions must be less than the mean path length for phonons in the {PMC}.

The source of the radiation is taken to be of two types; natural radioactive gamma decay and synchrotron radiation. Numerical examples using 57Fe are given for the two types of source radiation. Calculated results are contrasted for the two cases. Electromagnetic radiation produced by recoil-free gamma-ray emission has essentially the natural linewidth. Electromagnetic radiation from a synchrotron, even with the best monochromators available, has a relatively broad-band spectrum, essentially constant for these considerations. Polarization effects are considered. In general, the nuclear-resonant medium changes the polarization of the input radiation on traversing the medium. Calculations are presented to illustrate that synchrotron radiation studies using nuclear-resonant forward scattering have the potential for making high-precision measurements of hyperfine fields and recoilless fractions. An interesting aspect of nuclear-resonant forward scattering, relative to possible gamma-ray laser development, is the so-called “speed-up” effect.},

There were these recoilless processes that enabled to distinguish the gamma-radiation of natural width, and greatly encouraged the arising of traditional optics problems in the gamma range. The subject of interest in this article deals as well with the Mössbauer gamma optics. Essentially it is a gamma-ray (Mössbauer) susceptibility of the excited, non-equilibrium state of the nuclear spin system.

	abstract = {Time-domain Mössbauer spectroscopy has been interpreted by Hamermesh using a classical optical model. One of the most interesting aspects of the experiments is the observation of a “speed-up” effect. This speed-up effect can be observed by measuring the gamma radiation coming from the source after transmission through a nuclear-resonant “filter”, i.e., the elastic channel, using the delayed-coincidence time-to-amplitude conversion method. This time-domain speed-up effect occurs in the coherent forward scattering of the nuclear-resonant gamma radiation. Time-domain nuclear-resonant forward scattering results observing the inelastic channel, i.e., the X-ray following internal conversion, using a radioactive source have not been obtained previously. Such results are presented for the radioactive-source case using both 57Fe and 73Ge. These two isotopes were chosen because of the differences in the values of the internal conversion coefficients α, i.e., α is 8 and 1310, respectively, for the two cases. In each case experimental data, using both the elastic channel and the inelastic channel, are given. Commercial sources and absorbers of iron-in-rhodium foils were used for the 57Fe experiments. For the 73Ge experiments, we prepared our own sources by electroplating 73As onto Ge single crystals. The Ge absorber was the enriched 73Ge single crystal originally prepared by Pfeiffer. Fits to the experimental elastic-channel data are given using the classical optical model. Our preliminary experimental results using the inelastic channel are inconclusive.},

Since then, research on the feasibility of a gamma-ray laser has taken on a completely new character. A nuclear analog of the ruby laser has been proposed and many of the component steps for pumping the nuclei have been demonstrated experimentally. A quantitative model based upon the new data and the concepts of this decade shows the gamma-ray laser to be feasible if some real isotope has its properties sufficiently close to the ideals. The greatest positive impact has come from the discovery of giant resonances for pumping nuclei with photons that greatly reduce the levels of input power needed. Most recently, attention has been focused upon efforts to demonstrate prelasing levels of fluorescence from simulation nuclides and actual gamma-ray laser candidates. Problems being addressed are the acquisition of macroscopic samples of the best nuclei for testing and the demonstration of appropriate instrumentation.},

For this reason, sources of possible spurious contamination of the measurements were carefully considered. This paper reviews an analysis of possible sources as well as experimental limits on contamination of the isomeric yields. The question of spurious contributions from (n, γ) or (n, n′) reactions was examined by estimating the level of thermal, epithermal and fast neutron fluxes based on possible source material in the accelerator environments. Such possibilities were severely reduced by the range of photon energies employed in the studies of 1.5-6 {MeV}. The expected fluxes were below levels necessary to produce significant isomeric yields in this energy range. Next, experiments were conducted in accordance with standard neutron activation-foil techniques to directly measure any fluxes of neutrons in the accelerator environments. Measurements for fast neutron fluxes were completely negative under even the most likely conditions with a 6 {MeV} medical linac. Measurable fluxes of thermal and epithermal neutrons were obtained. However, in typical cases the amount of isomeric activation due to “slow” neutrons was 1\% of the total activation and 6\% in the worst case based on measured fluxes and known values of cross sections.},

	abstract = {Nuclei embedded in a lattice are submitted to interactions with their surroundings. This produces a randomly fluctuating microfield at the nuclei, perturbing their energy levels. These perturbations can be considered as stochastic processes. Many of the fluctuating phenomena represent the result of a very large number of very small changes. The standard description of such fluctuations is a Gaussian process, defined as a process for which only the first and second moments are different from zero. If a radiating nucleus is constantly perturbed the radiated field can be regarded as undergoing phase fluctuations around the unperturbed nuclear Bohr frequency ω0. The instant frequency can then be written as ω(t)=ω0-x(t), where x(t) is the value of a stochastic variable X with zero mean. The first-order correlation function, whose Fourier transform gives the radiated frequency spectrum, depends on the probability function governing X. For a Gaussian, stationary, delta-correlated process, it is shown that the frequency spectrum is Lorentzian. For an arbitrary perturbation having a broad spectrum, it is shown that the frequency spectrum is again Lorentzian. For a narrow perturbation spectrum, the corresponding frequency spectrum is Gaussian.},

The {NEEC} process would provide an excitation from the long-lived isomer to a depletion level with spin parity 17/2+, which lies only 4.85 {keV} higher in energy, and is itself a shorter-lived isomer that subsequently decays, releasing a substantial amount of stored energy (2429.8 {keV}). The depletion level decays to a 13/2+ state through a 267.9-{keV} transition that offers the opportunity for identification of {NEEC} because it does not occur in the natural decay of the long-lived isomer.

The theoretical performance limit for the dual effect multi-level isotope battery irradiated by 60Co radioisotope source was calculated, and the characteristics of each conversion mechanism were analyzed by using {MCNP}5. The results revealed that the {RPV} effect produced more electrical output than the {RV} effect, but the contribution of each effect on the battery was significant. The output performance of the multi-level isotope battery was characterized under 60Co source at dose rates of 0.103 {kGy}/h and 0.68 {kGy}/h. The theoretical and experimental study investigated the feasibility of combining two kinds of energy conversion mechanisms to enhance the performance of nuclear batteries. The use of 60Co radioisotope sources with a large activity and conversion modules with additional levels could obtain a considerable output performance. Moreover, the thickness influence of the {LYSO} scintillator on the performance limit in the first-level conversion module was studied to optimize the structural parameters of the multi-level dual effect isotope battery. The thickness of scintillator strongly affects the energy deposition distribution of gamma rays in the multi-level conversion module, resulting in changes of the output generated by {RV} and {RPV} effects, which in turn affects the total output of the battery.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the use of one of the safest isotopes known isotopes, Kr-85, as a candidate fuel source for deep space missions. This isotope comes from 0.286\% of fission events. There is a vast quantity of Kr-85 stored in spent fuel and it is continually being produced by nuclear reactors. In using Kr-85 with a novel Dual Cycle Conversion System ({DCCS}) it is feasible to boost the system efficiency from 26\% to 45\% over a single cycle device while only increasing the system mass by less than 1\%. The Kr-85 isotope is the ideal fuel for a Photon Intermediate Direct Energy Conversion ({PIDEC}) system. {PIDEC} is an excellent choice for the top cycle in a {DCCS}. In the top cycle, ionization and excitation of the Kr-85:Cl gas mixture (99\% Kr and 1\% Cl) from beta particles creates {KrCl}* excimer photons which are efficiently absorbed by diamond photovoltaic cells on the walls of the pressure vessels. The benefit of using the {DCCS} is that Kr-85 is capable of operating at high temperatures in the primary cycle and the residual heat can then be converted into electrical power in the bottom cycle which uses a Stirling Engine. The design of the {DCCS} begins with a spherical pressure vessel of radius 13.7 cm with 3.7 cm thick walls and is filled with a Kr-85:Cl gas mixture. The inner wall has diamond photovoltaic cells attached to it and there is a sapphire window between the diamond photovoltaic cells and the Kr-85:Cl gas mixture which shields the photovoltaic cells from beta particles. The {DCCS} without a gamma ray shield has specific power of 6.49 W/kg. A removable 6 cm thick tungsten shield is used to safely limit the radiation exposure levels of personnel. A shadow shield remains in the payload to protect the radiation sensitive components in the flight package. The estimated specific power of the unoptimized system design in this paper is about 2.33 W/kg. The specific power of an optimized system should be higher. The Kr-85 isotope is relatively safe because it will disperse quickly in case of an accident and if it enters the lungs there is no significant biological half-life.},

	abstract = {This review presents the current state of the knowledge regarding the use of radioactive sources to generate photonic light in scintillators as converters of ionizing radiation to electricity in photovoltaic cells. The possibility of using the phenomenon of the excitation of light photons in the scintillation materials during the interaction with particles and photons of ionizing radiation was analyzed in detail. The light photons obtained in such a way can generate an electric charge in photovoltaic cells. The whole process can be named as a nuclear cell (nuclear battery). Theoretically, the use of such physical phenomena seems to be an ideal practical solution to meet the energy needs of the modern world. However, there are many physical and technical problems that limit its widespread use in practical applications. In an ideal system, the ionizing radiation sources can emit the radiation for billions of years, and the energy of particles and photons from the radiation can be converted into photons in the scintillation material, with energy suitable to generate a photoelectric effect in a photovoltaic cell. Such a cascade sequence of different physical phenomena allows, from a theoretical point of view, for the creation of a virtually inexhaustible source of electricity. This review of historical and current literature reports aims to bring closer the idea of “energy perpetuum mobile”, which has troubled many scientists around the world for centuries.},

Here, we describe a protocol to achieve the external control of the isomeric nuclear decay by using electron vortex beams whose wave function has been especially designed and reshaped on demand. Recombination of these electrons into the isomer’s atomic shell can lead to the controlled release of the stored nuclear energy. On the example of 93mMo, we show theoretically that the use of tailored electron vortex beams increases the depletion by 4 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous nuclear decay of the isomer. Furthermore, specific orbitals can sustain an enhancement of the recombination cross section for vortex electron beams by as much as 6 orders of magnitude, providing a handle for manipulating the capture mechanism. These findings open new prospects for controlling the interplay between atomic and nuclear degrees of freedom, with potential energy-related and high-energy radiation source applications.},

	abstract = {X-ray-assisted nuclear excitation by electron capture ({NEEC}) into inner-shell atomic holes in a plasma environment generated by strong optical lasers is investigated theoretically. The considered scenario involves the interaction of a strong optical laser with a solid-state nuclear target leading to the generation of a plasma. In addition, intense x-ray radiation from the X-ray Free Electron Laser ({XFEL}) produces inner-shell holes in the plasma ions, into which {NEEC} may occur. As a case study, we consider the 4.85-{keV} transition starting from the 2.4-{MeV} long-lived 93mMo isomer that can be used to release the energy stored in this metastable nuclear state. We find that the recombination into 2p1/2 inner-shell holes is most efficient in driving the nuclear transition. The generation of inner-shell holes while the plasma is at a temperature of a few hundred {eV} can allow optimal conditions for {NEEC}, which are otherwise reached for steady-state plasma conditions in thermodynamical equilibrium only at few {keV}. The combination of x-ray and optical lasers presents two advantages: First, {NEEC} rates can be maximized at plasma temperatures where the photoexcitation rate remains low. Second, with {mJ}-class optical lasers and an {XFEL} repetition rate of 10 {kHz}, the {NEEC} excitation number can reach ≈1 depleted isomer per second and is competitive with scenarios recently envisaged at petawatt-class lasers.},

Analyses are performed for the depletion of the 93mMo isomer for which an unexpectedly large probability was measured in the beam-based experiment of Chiara et al. [Nature (London) 554, 216 (2018)]. The subsequent attempt at a theoretical description based on state-of-the-art atomic theory did not reproduce the experimental result [Wu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 212501 (2019)] and showed a dramatic disagreement with the experiment (by many orders of magnitude). This conflict calls for further research on the nature of isomer depletion mechanisms occurring in atomic processes. Here, we propose to consider the 93mMo isomer depletion as the nuclear excitation by electron capture in resonant transfer process taking into account the momentum distribution of the target electrons. Although our results only slightly shift the upper theoretical limit for the total 93mMo isomer depletion probability toward the experimental value, they show the importance of considering the Compton profile in the theoretical description, in particular for the L shell, for which the depletion probability increases by many orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {The process of nuclear excitation by electron capture in plasma environments generated by the interaction of ultrastrong optical lasers with solid-state samples is investigated theoretically. With the help of a plasma model, we perform a comprehensive study of the optimal parameters for the most efficient nuclear excitation and determine the corresponding laser setup requirements. We discern between the low-density plasma regime, modeled by scaling laws, and the high-density regime, for which we perform particle-in-cell calculations. As a nuclear transition case study we consider the 4.85-{keV} nuclear excitation starting from the long-lived 93mMo isomer. Our results show that the optimal plasma and laser parameters are sensitive to the chosen observable and that measurable rates of nuclear excitation and isomer depletion of 93mMo should be already achievable at laser facilities existing today.},

	doi = {10.1109/AERO.2019.8741919},
	abstract = {{NASA} has employed Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators ({RTGs}) to power many missions throughout the past several decades. The Multi-Mission {RTG} ({MMRTG}) used on Mars Science Laboratory is the most recent generator developed, and the only spaceflight-qualified system currently available. The enhanced Multi-Mission {RTG} ({eMMRTG}) would be an upgrade of the {MMRTG} using the most current thermoelectric ({TE}) technology, and would provide the space community with a system that would have substantially higher end-of-design-life ({EODL})power. The {NASA} {RPS} Program recently instantiated an {eMMRTG} system development project, evolving from an ongoing technology maturation effort at {JPL} to a project designed to mature and transition the skutterudite ({SKD}) {TE} couples and technology into an operational {RTG}. The project has made significant advances in maturing {SKD} technology for use in the {eMMRTG}, and is looking ahead to potential {RTG} system development. Mini-module and couple life tests have produced substantial performance data that has helped refine the couple design and support lifetime performance predictions. Additional strength and thermoelectric properties tests have been performed to verify the design specifications and robustness of the candidate {TE} couples. Replacing the current {MMRTG} couples with {SKD} also necessitates system design changes that must be well understood. Recent systems engineering studies have focused on minimizing risk associated with updating the flight-proven {MMRTG} design. Upgrading the module insulation has been shown to result in 98\% lower levels of {CH}4/H2 outgassing products. Performance analysis has been completed using the most recent {TE} couple sizes in order to understand the maximum acceptable power degradation rate to achieve the required {eMMRTG} power of 77 W at {EODL}. This paper provides an update on recent {SKD} technology maturation efforts and the results of several systems engineering tasks that continue to pave the way for successful system development.},

	abstract = {A multimission radioisotope thermoelectric generator ({MMRTG}), developed by the {US} Department of Energy for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, powers the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover on Mars. New thermoelectric couples ({TECs}) have been developed in recent years that offer significant improvements over the {TECs} used in the {MMRTG}. The maturity of the new {TECs} and the design flexibility of the {MMRTG} enable a low-risk system upgrade that is predicted to substantially enhance the {MMRTG}’s performance. System design trades are looking at changing the {TECs} and increasing the hot-side temperature to find the best combination of performance and program cost in this enhanced {MMRTG} ({eMMRTG}). Initial studies indicated that a low-risk enhancement would be to use skutterudite ({SKD}) materials developed at {JPL} to form {TECs} for the {eMMRTG}. Simply replacing the {PbTe}/{TAGS} {TECs} with {SKD} {TECs} and making a few low-risk modifications to the {MMRTG} design could potentially provide a 25\% increase in power output at beginning of life ({BOL}). More important than the {BOL} power output increase is the end of design life ({EODL}) power output increase. With the anticipated lower degradation rate of the {SKD} materials, it is anticipated that the {EODL} power output will be more than 50\% higher than for the {MMRTG} (with {EODL} defined as 17 years from fueling). This paper presents an overview of the results of the initial trades leading to the pursuit of the {eMMRTG} and the progress made since those were concluded.},

The Monte Carlo transport code {MCNP}6 is used to provide realistic estimates of the theoretical levels of charge generation, which is in turn used to make predictions about the power output from three-dimensional betavoltaics. The focus of this work is on silicon and promethium-147, but other semiconductors and radioisotopes are considered as well. In the case of silicon diodes with three-dimensional features that are comparable to what is commercially available we estimate that power densities in the range of 20-25 {mW}/cm3 can be achieved at efficiencies of 2.9-5.8\% when coupled with promethium-147 oxide.},

	abstract = {Energy dense power sources are critical to the development of compact, remote sensors for terrestrial and space applications. Nuclear batteries using β–emitting radioisotopes possess energy densities 1000 times greater than chemical batteries. Their power generation is a function of β- flux saturation point relative to the planar (2D) configuration, β- range, and semiconductor converter. An approach to increase power density in a beta-photovoltaic (β-{PV}) nuclear battery is described. By using volumetric (3D) configuration, the radioisotope, nickel-63 (63Ni) in a chloride solution was integrated in a phosphor film ({ZnS}:Cu,Al) where the β- energy is converted into optical energy. The optical energy was converted to electrical energy via an indium gallium phosphate ({InGaP}) photovoltaic ({PV}) cell, which was optimized for low light illumination and closely matched to radioluminescence ({RL}) spectrum. With 15mCi of 63Ni activity, the 3D configuration energy values surpassed 2D configuration results. The highest total power conversion efficiency (ηt) of 3D configuration was 0.289\% at 200µm compared 0.0638\% for 2D configuration at 50µm. The highest electrical power and ηt for the 3D configuration were 3.35 {nWe}/cm2 at an activity of 30mCi and 0.289\% at an activity of 15mCi, respectively. By using 3D configuration, the interaction space between the radioisotope source and scintillation material increased, allowing for significant electrical energy output, relative to the 2D configuration. These initial results represent a first step to increase nuclear battery power density from microwatts to milliwatts per 1000cm3 with the implementation of higher energy β- sources.},

We have used the acquired experience and the high technologies developed for the '{BUK}' {NPP} with a thermoelectric conversion of thermal (nuclear) energy into electrical one in the development under the order of {RAO} '{GAZPROM}' of the natural gas fired self contained thermoelectric current sources ({AIT}-500) and heat and electricity sources ({TEP}-500). These are intended for electrochemical rust protection of gas pipelines and for the electricity and heat supply to the telemetric and microwave-link systems located along the gas pipelines. Of special interest at the moment are the new developments of self contained current sources with the electrical output of \{approx\}500 Wel for new gas pipelines being constructed under the projects such as the 'Yamal-Europe' project. The electrochemical rust protection of gas pipelines laying on unsettled and non-electrified territory of arctic regions of Russia is performed by means of the so-called Cathodic Protection Stations ({CPS}). Accounting for a complex of rather rigid requirements imposed by arctic operating conditions, the most attractive sources of electricity supply to the {CPS} are the thermoelectric heat-into-electricity converters and the generators ({TEG}). This paper deals with the essential results of the development, investigation and testing of unconventional {TEGs} using the low-temperature bismuth-tellurium thermoelectric batteries assembled together as tubular thermoelectric batteries with a radial ring geometry built into the gas-heated thermoelectric modules, which are collected to make up either the thermoelectric plants for heat and electricity supply or the self contained power sources. One of the peculiarities of these plants is the combination of the {CPS} proper function with a number of additional service possibilities, among them the use of natural gas directly from the high pressure gas pipeline, remote monitoring, the utilization of heat etc. (author)},

	abstract = {We describe here efforts to create and study magnetized electron–positron pair plasmas, the existence of which in astrophysical environments is well-established. Laboratory incarnations of such systems are becoming ever more possible due to novel approaches and techniques in plasma, beam and laser physics. Traditional magnetized plasmas studied to date, both in nature and in the laboratory, exhibit a host of different wave types, many of which are generically unstable and evolve into turbulence or violent instabilities. This complexity and the instability of these waves stem to a large degree from the difference in mass between the positively and the negatively charged species: the ions and the electrons. The mass symmetry of pair plasmas, on the other hand, results in unique behaviour, a topic that has been intensively studied theoretically and numerically for decades, but experimental studies are still in the early stages of development. A levitated dipole device is now under construction to study magnetized low-energy, short-Debye-length electron–positron plasmas; this experiment, as well as a stellarator device that is in the planning stage, will be fuelled by a reactor-based positron source and make use of state-of-the-art positron cooling and storage techniques. Relativistic pair plasmas with very different parameters will be created using pair production resulting from intense laser–matter interactions and will be confined in a high-field mirror configuration. We highlight the differences between and similarities among these approaches, and discuss the unique physics insights that can be gained by these studies.},

The magnetic force generated by the field gradient is several thousand times larger than that by the magnetic flux density alone. So the {HGMS} shows excellent performance compared with other magnetic separators. These matrices are usually composed of stainless wires having high magnetization characteristics. This paper deals with superconducting {HGMS} which is aimed for purifying wastewater by using stainless steel matrix. Background magnetic field up to 6T is generated by a superconducting solenoid and the stainless steel matrices are arranged inside of the solenoid. In order to calculate magnetic forces exerting on magnetic particles in wastewater, it is important to calculate magnetic field and magnetic field gradient those are proportional to the magnetic force acting on the particle. So we presents magnetic field distribution analysis result and estimates how many times of magnetic force will act on a particle when the matrix are arranged or not. Magnetic field is calculated in 3 dimensions by using Finite Element Method ({FEM}) and also compared with results obtained from 2 dimensional analysis.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fusion reactions of D-D are examined in an environment comprised of high density cold fuel embedded in metal lattices in which a small fuel portion is activated by hot neutrons. Such an environment provides for enhanced screening of the Coulomb barrier due to conduction and shell electrons of the metal lattice, or by plasma induced by ionizing radiation (γ quanta). We show that neutrons are far more efficient than energetic charged particles, such as light particles (e−,e+) or heavy particles (p,d,α) in transferring kinetic energy to fuel nuclei (D) to initiate fusion processes. It is well known that screening increases the probability of tunneling through the Coulomb barrier. Electron screening also significantly increases the probability of large vs small angle Coulomb scattering of the reacting nuclei to enable subsequent nuclear reactions via tunneling. This probability is incorporated into the astrophysical factor S(E). Aspects of screening effects to enable calculation of nuclear reaction rates are also evaluated, including Coulomb scattering and localized heating of the cold fuel, primary D-D reactions, and subsequent reactions with both the fuel and the lattice nuclei. The effect of screening for enhancement of the total nuclear reaction rate is a function of multiple parameters including fuel temperature and the relative scattering probability between the fuel and lattice metal nuclei. Screening also significantly increases the probability of interaction between hot fuel and lattice nuclei increasing the likelilhood of Oppenheimer-Phillips processes opening a potential route to reaction multiplication. We demonstrate that the screened Coulomb potential of the target ion is determined by the nonlinear Vlasov potential and not by the Debye potential. In general, the effect of screening becomes important at low kinetic energy of the projectile. We examine the range of applicability of both the analytical and asymptotic expressions for the well-known electron screening lattice potential energy Ue, which is valid only for E≫Ue (E is the energy in the center of mass reference frame). We demonstrate that for E≤Ue, a direct calculation of Gamow factor for screened Coulomb potential is required to avoid unreasonably high values of the enhancement factor f(E) by the analytical—and more so by the asymptotic—formulas.},

Both methods build upon decades of research, and the latter benefits from conventional nuclear fission and fusion results. However, this nascent technology doesn’t require fissile isotopes and avoids nuclear weapons proliferation concerns from uranium 235U isotopic enrichment or plutonium 239Pu separation. Of particular note, {LCF} doesn’t need power hungry magnets, lasers, or particle beams. Potentially, it could provide watts to hundreds of kilowatts of electrical power and process heat suitable for space power and high Isp nuclear electric propulsion ({NEP}) as well as distributed terrestrial power. Finally, there are indications that {LCF} fast-fission products are more benign than those of conventional fission reactors. Our goal is to scale the reactions and increase the power output through higher temperature operation and increased material masses.},

	abstract = {Thermophotovoltaics ({TPVs}) convert predominantly infrared wavelength light to electricity via the photovoltaic effect, and can enable approaches to energy storage1,2 and conversion3–9 that use higher temperature heat sources than the turbines that are ubiquitous in electricity production today. Since the first demonstration of 29\% efficient {TPVs} (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten emitter at 2,000 °C (ref. 10), {TPV} fabrication and performance have improved11,12. However, despite predictions that {TPV} efficiencies can exceed 50\% (refs. 11,13,14), the demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32\%, albeit at much lower temperatures below 1,300 °C (refs. 13–15). Here we report the fabrication and measurement of {TPV} cells with efficiencies of more than 40\% and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem {TPV} cells. The {TPV} cells are two-junction devices comprising {III}–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 {eV} that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900–2,400 °C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 {eV} device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)\% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. A 1.2/1.0 {eV} device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)\% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. These cells can be integrated into a {TPV} system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy. This creates a pathway for thermal energy grid storage to reach sufficiently high efficiency and sufficiently low cost to enable decarbonization of the electricity grid.},

Here we report the first experimental study of the maximum energy of proton beams accelerated from sub-micrometric foils perforated with holes of nanometric size. By showing the lack of energy enhancement in comparison to standard flat foils, our results suggest that the high contrast routinely achieved with a double plasma mirror does not prevent damaging of the nanostructures prior to the main interaction. Particle-in-cell simulations support that even a short scale length plasma, formed in the last hundreds of femtoseconds before the peak of an ultrashort laser pulse, fills the holes and hinders enhanced electron heating. Our findings reinforce the need for improved laser contrast, as well as for accurate control and diagnostics of on-target plasma formation.},

Both experiments and simulations have revealed that protons are accelerated up to a maximum cut-off energy during this process. Several attempts have been made to find a universal model for laser proton acceleration in the target normal sheath acceleration regime. While these models can qualitatively explain most experimental findings, they can hardly be used as predictive models, for example, for the energy cut-off of accelerated protons, as many of the underlying parameters are often unknown. Here we analyze experiments on laser proton acceleration in which scans of laser and target parameters were performed. We derive empirical scaling laws from these parameter scans and combine them in a scaling law for the proton energy cut-off that incorporates the laser pulse energy, the laser pulse duration, the focal spot radius, and the target thickness. Using these scaling laws, we give examples for predicting the proton energy cut-off and conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art laser systems.},

We report on recent experimental results on proton acceleration from laser interaction with foil targets at ultra-relativistic intensities. We show a threefold increase of the proton cut-off energy when a micrometer scale-length pre-plasma is introduced by irradiation with a low energy femtosecond pre-pulse.

	abstract = {Laser-driven proton acceleration is a growing field of interest in the high-power laser community. One of the big challenges related to the most routinely used laser-driven ion acceleration mechanism, Target-Normal Sheath Acceleration ({TNSA}), is to enhance the laser-to-proton energy transfer such as to maximize the proton kinetic energy and number. A way to achieve this is using nanostructured target surfaces in the laser-matter interaction. In this paper, we show that nanowire structures can increase the maximum proton energy by a factor of two, triple the proton temperature and boost the proton numbers, in a campaign performed on the ultra-high contrast 10 {TW} laser at the Lund Laser Center ({LLC}). The optimal nanowire length, generating maximum proton energies around 6 {MeV}, is around 1–2 \$\${\textbackslash}textbackslashupmu\$\$m. This nanowire length is sufficient to form well-defined highly-absorptive {NW} forests and short enough to minimize the energy loss of hot electrons going through the target bulk. Results are further supported by Particle-In-Cell simulations. Systematically analyzing nanowire length, diameter and gap size, we examine the underlying physical mechanisms that are provoking the enhancement of the longitudinal accelerating electric field. The parameter scan analysis shows that optimizing the spatial gap between the nanowires leads to larger enhancement than by the nanowire diameter and length, through increased electron heating.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This Monte Carlo simulation work aims at studying a new radiotherapy approach called proton-minibeam radiation therapy ({pMBRT}). The main objective of this proof of concept was the evaluation of the possible gain in tissue sparing, thanks to the spatial fractionation of the dose, which could be used to deposit higher and potentially curative doses in clinical cases where tissue tolerances are a limit for conventional methods. Methods: Monte Carlo simulations ({GATE} v.6) have been used as a method to calculate the ratio of the peak-to-valley doses ({PVDR}) for arrays of proton minibeams of 0.7 mm width and several center-to-center distances, at different depths in a water phantom. The beam penumbras were also evaluated as an important parameter for tissue sparing, for example, in the treatment of non-cancer diseases like epilepsy. Two proton energies were considered in this study: a clinically relevant energy (105 {MeV}) and a very high energy (1 {GeV}), to benefit from a reduced lateral scattering. For the latter case, an interlaced geometry was also evaluated. Results: Higher or similar {PVDR} than the ones obtained in x-rays minibeam radiation therapy were achieved in several {pMBRT} configurations. In addition, for the two energies studied, the beam penumbras are smaller than in the case of Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Conclusions: The high {PVDR} obtained for some configurations and the small penumbras in comparison with existing radiosurgery techniques, suggest a potential gain in healthy tissue sparing in this new technique. Biological studies are warranted to assess the effects of {pMBRT} on both normal and tumoral tissues.},

A second-generation system has been designed to increase the total neutron output from an upgraded gaseous deuterium target to 5×10¹¹ {DD} n/s, generating higher neutron flux at the imaging plane and dramatically reducing interrogation time, while maintaining high spatial resolution and low geometric unsharpness. A description of the neutron generator and imaging system, including the beamline, target and detector platform, is given in this paper. State of the art neutron moderators, collimators and imaging detector components are also discussed in the context of increasing specimen throughput and optimizing image quality.

	abstract = {A standard product line of high yield neutron generators has been developed at Adelphi Technology Inc. The generators use the D-D fusion reaction and are driven by an ion beam supplied by a microwave ion source. Yields of up to 5×109 n/s have been achieved, which are comparable to those obtained using the more efficient D-T reaction. The microwave-driven plasma uses the electron cyclotron resonance ({ECR}) to produce a high plasma density for high current and high atomic ion species. These generators have an actively pumped vacuum system that allows operation at reduced pressure in the target chamber, increasing the overall system reliability. Variations of these generators have been produced to increase the yield and total flux available. Several of the generators have been enclosed in radiation shielding/moderator structures designed for customer specifications. These generators have been proven to be useful for prompt gamma neutron activation analysis ({PGNAA}), neutron activation analysis ({NAA}) and fast neutron radiography. Pulsed and continuous operation has been demonstrated. Larger thermal neutron fluxes are expected to be obtained by multiple ion beams striking a central target that is filled with moderating material. Thus these generators make excellent fast, epithermal and thermal neutron sources for laboratories and industrial applications that require neutrons with safe operation, small footprint, low cost and small regulatory burden.},

For foils with a wide range of n0, the required I0 and l0 for the regime are theoretically estimated and verified with the particle-in-cell code {ILLUMINATION}. It is shown for the first time by 2D simulations that high-density monoenergetic ion beams with energy above {GeV}/u and divergence of 10° are produced by circularly polarized lasers at intensities of 1022 W/cm2, which are within reach of current laser systems.},

Our two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations also show that the proton acceleration process can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, a strong positive longitudinal electric field appears near the rear boundary of the plasma slab after the driving beam has passed through it. This acceleration process is similar to the target normal sheath acceleration scheme by the interaction between intense pulsed laser with overdense plasma targets. In the second stage, the accelerated protons experience a long-range acceleration process with a two-stream instability between the high-energy driving beam and the proton beam. Further analyses show that this accelerated proton beam is equipped with the property of good collimation and high energy.

We detailed the microphysics involved in the ion acceleration mechanism, which requires investigating the role of self-generated plasma electric and magnetic fields. The concept of efficient generation of quasi-monoenergetic electron and proton beam from near critical density gas targets may be verified experimentally at advanced high power – high repetition rate laser facilities e.g. {ELI}-{ALPS}.

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the basic principles of magnetic neutron scattering and its potential applications. The scattering of slow neutrons is a very powerful technique to investigate the structure and dynamics of condensed matter. It is found that for the purpose of neutron scattering investigations there exists two types of neutron sources, including reactor and spallation neutron source. The neutrons emerging from these sources have very high energies, and are therefore moderated to have useful energy ranges. The neutrons are called thermal, cold, or hot depending on the temperature of the moderator. The incident neutron flux is equal to the normalized number density times the neutron velocity. The value of the neutron scattering length of a nucleus depends on the spin state of the nucleus–neutron system. It is observed that neutron scattering from naturally occurring elements, which are often composed of different isotopes with zero and nonzero nuclear spins, is complex. The scattering lengths depend not only on the kind of element, but also on the kind of isotope and the quantum number of the angular momentum of nucleus–neutron system. It is found that inelastic magnetic neutron scattering, like the inelastic nuclear scattering, can originate either from single particle excitations like crystal-field excitations or collective excitations like spin waves.},

	abstract = {A substantial body of research is necessary in order to be able to make reliable predictions on the performance and safety of Accelerator Driven Systems ({ADS}), in particular of their spallation targets. So far, practical experience has resulted from the development of research neutron sources only. Next to fission and fusion, spallation is an efficient process for releasing neutrons from nuclei. Unlike the other two reactions, it is an endothermal process and can, therefore, not be used per se in energy generation. In order to sustain a spallation reaction, an energetic beam of particles, most commonly protons, must be supplied onto a heavy target. Spallation can, however, play an important role as a source of neutrons whose flux can be easily controlled via the driving beam. Although sophisticated Monte Carlo codes exist to compute all aspects of a spallation facility, many features can be understood on the basis of simple physics arguments. Technically a spallation facility is very demanding, not only because a reliable and economic accelerator of high power is needed to drive the reaction, but also, and in particular, because high levels of radiation and heat are generated in the target which are difficult to cope with. Radiation effects in a spallation environment are different from those commonly encountered in a reactor and are probably even more temperature dependent than the latter because of the high gas production rate. A commonly favored solution is the use of molten heavy metal targets. While radiation damage is not a problem in this case, except for the container, other issues need to be considered. R\&D carried out for the development of spallation neutron sources will thus be beneficial also directly for {ADS}.},

This was largely based on facility specifications, with some description of their uses, for instance in fundamental ultra-high-intensity interactions, secondary source generation, and inertial confinement fusion ({ICF}). With the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Professors Donna Strickland and Gerard Mourou for the development of the technique of chirped pulse amplification ({CPA}), which made these lasers possible, we celebrate by providing a comprehensive update of the current status of ultra-high-power lasers and demonstrate how the technology has developed. We are now in the era of multi-petawatt facilities coming online, with 100 {PW} lasers being proposed and even under construction. In addition to this there is a pull towards development of industrial and multi-disciplinary applications, which demands much higher repetition rates, delivering high-average powers with higher efficiencies and the use of alternative wavelengths: mid-{IR} facilities. So apart from a comprehensive update of the current global status, we want to look at what technologies are to be deployed to get to these new regimes, and some of the critical issues facing their development.},

Conceptual and experimental breakthroughs obtained over the last years have initiated a rapid growth of the research field, and increased maturity of underlying technology allows an increasing number of research groups to engage in experimental R\&D. We briefly describe the fundamental mechanisms of {PWFA}, from which its chief attractions arise. Most importantly, this is the capability of extremely rapid acceleration of electrons and positrons at gradients many orders of magnitude larger than in conventional accelerators. This allows the size of accelerator units to be shrunk from the kilometre to metre scale, and possibly the quality of accelerated electron beam output to be improved by orders of magnitude. In turn, such compact and high-quality accelerators are potentially transformative for applications across natural, material and life sciences. This overview provides contextual background for the manuscripts of this issue, resulting from a Theo Murphy meeting held in the summer of 2018. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue ‘Directions in particle beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration’.},

	abstract = {High-energy particle accelerators have been crucial in providing a deeper understanding of fundamental particles and the forces that govern their interactions. To increase the energy of the particles or to reduce the size of the accelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield acceleration1–5, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong electric fields (so called ‘wakefields’), is one such promising acceleration technique. Experiments have shown that an intense laser pulse6–9 or electron bunch10,11 traversing a plasma can drive electric fields of tens of gigavolts per metre and above—well beyond those achieved in conventional radio-frequency accelerators (about 0.1 gigavolt per metre). However, the low stored energy of laser pulses and electron bunches means that multiple acceleration stages are needed to reach very high particle energies5,12. The use of proton bunches is compelling because they have the potential to drive wakefields and to accelerate electrons to high energy in a single acceleration stage13. Long, thin proton bunches can be used because they undergo a process called self-modulation14–16, a particle–plasma interaction that splits the bunch longitudinally into a series of high-density microbunches, which then act resonantly to create large wakefields. The Advanced Wakefield ({AWAKE}) experiment at {CERN}17–19 uses high-intensity proton bunches—in which each proton has an energy of 400 gigaelectronvolts, resulting in a total bunch energy of 19 kilojoules—to drive a wakefield in a ten-metre-long plasma. Electron bunches are then injected into this wakefield. Here we present measurements of electrons accelerated up to two gigaelectronvolts at the {AWAKE} experiment, in a demonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. Measurements were conducted under various plasma conditions and the acceleration was found to be consistent and reliable. The potential for this scheme to produce very high-energy electron bunches in a single accelerating stage20 means that our results are an important step towards the development of future high-energy particle accelerators21,22.},

	abstract = {A revival of interest for production of neutrons by light energetic projectiles has been arisen recently by the advent of new projects in nuclear technology such as accelerator-driven nuclear reactors, nuclear waste transmutation and the use of radioactive beams. In this context we try to estimate which of the light incident particles, namely protons or deuterons, are more favourable for neutron production. The problem is investigated by varying the incident energy of these projectiles for different target materials and assemblies. The averaged multiplicities, angular and energy distributions of neutrons produced are estimated and compared using the simplest target geometry. In addition, the energy gain factor, i.e. the ratio of the energy produced in the sub-critical target-fuel assembly to the one delivered by the beam, is presented for both of the incident particles as a function of their kinetic energy. It is shown that at lower energies ({\textbackslash}textless600MeV), the combination of deuteron beam with light metal target is the most efficient solution for energy generation, whereas at higher energies ({\textbackslash}textgreater1GeV) the difference between various combinations becomes less significant.},

In this paper, we will outline how such an approach has become a reality, and recall some of the past successes since the first {TENDL} release in 2008. Next, we will demonstrate the performance of the latest {TENDL} releases for different application fields, as well as new approaches for uncertainty quantification based on Bayesian inference methods and possible differential and integral adjustments. Also, current limitations of the library performances due to modelling and needs for new and more precise experimental data will be outlined.},

The resulting expression for the baryon mass in the magnetic field is written explicitly with the account of hyperfine, one pion exchange, and one gluon exchange (color Coulomb) interaction. The neutron mass is fast decreasing with the magnetic field, losing 1/2 of its value at {eB}∼0.25 {GeV}2 and is nearly zero at {eB}∼0.5 {GeV}2. Possible physical consequences of the calculated mass trajectory of the neutron, Mn(B), are presented and discussed.},

Taking into account two facts, (i) the existence of a pressure anisotropy in the presence of a magnetic field and (ii) that the quantum field theory contribution to the pressure is non-negligible, we show that the maximum value that the inner magnetic field of a star can reach while being in agreement with the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium between the gravitational and matter pressures becomes 1017 G, an order of magnitude smaller than the previous value obtained through the scalar virial theorem; that the magnetic field has a negligible effect on the neutron system's equation of state; that the system's magnetic susceptibility increases with the temperature; and that the specific heat {CV} does not significantly change with the magnetic field in the range of temperatures characteristic of protoneutron stars.},

	abstract = {The motion of neutrons in magnetic traps is considered for various cases of neutron polarization. The results of implementing such traps in practice and special features of experiments studying magnetic neutron storage are discussed. The problem of neutron losses during injection via magnetic valves can be solved by conjoining a magnetic trap with a converter of cold neutrons into ultracold ones or with a source of ultracold neutrons. Prospects for expanding neutron-storage experiments by invoking a correlation analysis of neutron decay and by using the transport properties of charged particles in a nonuniform magnetic field are analyzed. In such an investigation, the recording of the storage time of neutrons proper can be supplemented with the detection of decay protons and electrons and with a parallel measurement of the asymmetries of proton and electron emission with respect to the magnetic field. A set of relative measurements permits improving the accuracy of an experimental determination of the neutron lifetime and combining this determination with the determination of correlation coefficients. On this basis, it is possible to find directly the ratio of the weak-interaction constants and the constants themselves. The application of the most advanced reactor and accelerator technologies to subcritical electric nuclear devices optimized for generating cold and ultracold neutrons, along with the use of solid deuterium and superfluid helium, creates preconditions for developing a neutron plant and for launching neutron studies at accelerators. Thus, the work that has been done as a development of V.V. Vladimirsky's proposals on magnetic neutron storage is analyzed, and the potential of a further use of ultracold neutrons and magnetic devices for deploying a full-scale precision experiment to study the beta decay of polarized neutrons is demonstrated.},

As most of these deaths are in developing countries, without internationally coordinated efforts this polarized situation will continue. As yet, however, no studies have quantified nation-to-nation consumer responsibility for global mortality due to both primary and secondary {PM}2.5 particles. Here we quantify the global footprint of {PM}2.5-driven premature deaths for the 19 G20 nations in a position to lead such efforts. G20 consumption in 2010 was responsible for 1.983 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.685–2.285] million premature deaths, at an average age of 67, including 78.6 [71.5–84.8] thousand infant deaths, implying that the G20 lifetime consumption of about 28 [24–33] people claims one life. Our results indicate that G20 nations should take responsibility for their footprint rather than focusing solely on transboundary air pollution, as this would expand opportunities for reducing {PM}2.5-driven premature mortality. Given the infant mortality footprint identified, it would moreover contribute to ensuring infant lives are not unfairly left behind in countries like South Africa, which have a weak relationship with G20 nations.},

Air pollution is a complex mixture of gaseous and particulate materials that vary depending on their source and physicochemical features. Each material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter ({PM}2.5). In particular, there is more and more evidence that {PM}2.5 exerts adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing substantially (mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and inflammation) to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular adverse effects of short-and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly for the {PM}2.5 size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than what has been thought up to now.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comparative assessment of severe accident risks in the energy sector, based on the historical experience of fossil (coal, oil, natural gas, and {LPG} [Liquefied Petroleum Gas]) and hydro chains contained in the comprehensive Energy-related Severe Accident Database ({ENSAD}), as well as Probabilistic Safety Assessment ({PSA}) for the nuclear chain. Full energy chains were considered because accidents can take place at every stage of the chain. Comparative analyses for the years 1969–2000 included a total of 1870 severe (≥ 5 fatalities) accidents, amounting to 81,258 fatalities. Although 79.1\% of all accidents and 88.9\% of associated fatalities occurred in less developed, non-{OECD} countries, industrialized {OECD} countries dominated insured losses (78.0\%), reflecting their substantially higher insurance density and stricter safety regulations. Aggregated indicators and frequency-consequence (F-N) curves showed that energy-related accident risks in non-{OECD} countries are distinctly higher than in {OECD} countries. Hydropower in non-{OECD} countries and upstream stages within fossil energy chains are most accident-prone. Expected fatality rates are lowest for Western hydropower and nuclear power plants; however, the maximum credible consequences can be very large. Total economic damages due to severe accidents are substantial, but small when compared with natural disasters. Similarly, external costs associated with severe accidents are generally much smaller than monetized damages caused by air pollution.},

To reach this status, some basic principles have been applied which sets it apart from other libraries: reproducible dedicated evaluations when differential data are available, through determination of nuclear models implemented in {TALYS} and their parameters, completeness (with or without experimental data), format and processing standardization, automation of production and reproducibility. In this paper, we will outline how such an approach has become a reality, and recall some of the past successes since the first {TENDL} release in 2008. Next, we will demonstrate the performance of the latest {TENDL} releases for different application fields, as well as new approaches for uncertainty quantification based on Bayesian inference methods and possible differential and integral adjustments. Also, current limitations of the library performances due to modelling and needs for new and more precise experimental data will be outlined.},

	abstract = {The {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of {ENDF}/B-{VII}.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the {US} Cross Section Evaluation Working Group ({CSEWG}) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of {JENDL}-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 {MeV} neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the {VII}.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for {VII}.0 for a wide range of {MCNP} simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 {keV} are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the {ENDF}/B-{VII}.0 publication [M.

This article analyzes the diverse ways that civilian and military officials worked to contain knowledge about the radiation effects. The article oho explores the reasons why the radiation deaths and other residual effects elicited such censorship attempts. In particular, American officials did not want the atomic bombs linked with chemical and biological warfare and some objected to radiohgical warfare. The article draws on numerous archives and manuscript collections, many little known, to underscore the context for the censorship activities as the war ended and the U.S. moved into a new kind of militarized peace.},
